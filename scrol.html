	<p>Second World War at Sea is a game series produced by Avalanche Press covering naval
	combat during World War II. The series is based
	on Avalanche Press' Great War at Sea. The two series share many features although they 
	are separate both from a rules standpoint and a 
	scale standpoint (see SOPAC below).The Kaiser's Fleet was the first supplement based
	on an alternate history Avalanche call the Second 
	Great War, with World War I assumed to have been brought to a halt in 1916 by US
	President Woodrow Wilson's peace proposals. This leaves
	Imperial Germany in existence, along with the Imperial German Fleet, and its patron 
	Kaiser Wilhelm. The Imperial fleet's development is 
	extrapolated to 1940 at which point the Second Great War breaks out between the Central 
	Powers and the Entente, with the Entente 
	reinforced by Poland and later Holland. The supplement had 210 counters and 25 scenarios
	covering operations in the Atlantic between 
	the Imperial Germans, France and later Britain.The Kaiser's Fleet was the first supplement

	<p>Each game is played on an operational map divided into a grid of squares, each representing
	a 36-mile-wide area. Unit counters do not 
	move directly on the operational map, but rather are represented by fleet markers. Players plot
	their unit's moves, and track damage and 
	fuel consumption, on separate data sheets for their associated fleets. Each provided operational 
	scenario will task each player with 
	soecific objectives - run a convoy to a port, prevent that convoy passing, bring the
	opposing fleet to battle, and so on. When two 
	opposing fleets come into contact on the operational map, combat switches to the tactical map.

  The tactical map is a grid of hexagons on which individual warship counters can manoeuvre. 
  When units come within range of each other,
  their gunnery and other factors are translated into numbers of dice rolled to attempt to 
  hit enemy targets. These die rolls are subject to
  various modifiers for environmental, technical and other factors. Hits, especially those 
  which penetrate armour, will gradually erode the
  ability of a ship to fight, and ultimately can sink it. Once play on the tactical map
  terminates it resumes on the operational map until 
  the next time two fleets come into contact.The Kaiser's Fleet was the first supplement based
  on an alternate history Avalanche call the
